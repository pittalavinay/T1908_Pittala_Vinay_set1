1. Code Generation & Debugging

"Assume you had 20 years of experience in the role of java developer. Generate a Java project with three files:
Vehicle.java: Defines a Vehicle class with id, speed, temperature, and fuel fields.
FleetManager.java: Manages a list of Vehicle objects, computes average speed, temperature, and fuel, and triggers alerts for temperature > 110Â°C ('Critical Overheating') and fuel < 15% ('Low Fuel Warning').
Main.java: Loads vehicle data from a CSV file, uses FleetManager to process data, and prints results and alerts."


2. Code Review & Refactoring

"You are a senior developer Now assume me as a junior developer review and Refactor the following Java code to use object-oriented principles:
Replace arrays with a Vehicle class.
Create a FleetManager class to manage vehicles and compute averages.
Use constants for thresholds (temperature, fuel).
Add constructors, encapsulation, input validation, and exception handling.
Read vehicle data from a CSV file using BufferedReader or Scanner with error checks."

3. Unit & Integration Testing

"Now Assume you had 30 years of experience in the Testing Write JUnit tests for the Vehicle and FleetManager classes:
Test that a vehicle with temperature=120 triggers 'Critical Overheating'.
Test that a vehicle with fuel=10 triggers 'Low Fuel Warning'.
Test that a fleet with speeds [80, 90, 100] computes average speed = 90.
Test boundary cases: temperature=110 triggers alert, fuel=15 does not trigger warning.
Test that an empty dataset throws an exception."

4. Documentation

"Create a README.md for the project with:
Introduction
Explanation of classes and functions
Sample input and output examples
Add the javaDoc comments to the project."


5. Concurrency

"Extend the FleetManager and Vehicle classes to support concurrency:
Use Thread or ExecutorService to simulate vehicles updating speed, temperature, and fuel concurrently.
Use synchronized or ReentrantLock to prevent race conditions when FleetManager aggregates data.
Compare single-threaded and multi-threaded performance and print results."
